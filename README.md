Interactive Information Poster

Using the statistics from a study done at Waterloo University, I will create a poster that displays the percentage of Canadians over 15 who smoke every year. To make this infographic interactive, I have decided to make the year (which will increase in 10 year intervals) a hover or clickable element. Once the user  selects a year, the cigarette will change in size to display the percentage of Canadians who smoke by reaching the corresponding line on the graph. I think this will gain full user interactivity, as users must interact with the poster to see the data they are looking for. The element that changes, the cigarette, is also representative of the data being portrayed. As this happens, the actual percentage will appear on the cigarette to give an accurate statistic numerically as well as visually.
